I updated the system architecture by converting Part 1 from a WPF application into an MVC web application to support a more scalable, modular, and role-driven environment. As part of this migration, I created multiple controllers—HomePageController, LecturerPageController, ManagerPageController, CoordinatorPageController, and the newly added HRController—to align with the MVC separation of concerns and ensure role-specific logic is isolated within the correct components.
Each controller was paired with dedicated views. For the lecturer workflow, I added a LecturerPage view folder containing Lecturer.cshtml and Claims.cshtml. The Lecturer.cshtml page provides navigation and functionality for IC lecturers, while the Claims.cshtml page enables users to submit claim information and upload supporting documentation. The Manager, Coordinator, and HR views were also created to provide their respective interfaces for reviewing, approving, or managing claims.
